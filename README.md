# YOLOv5 Object Detection on Video

This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv5 for real-time object detection on video files. The script captures objects from a video source and generates an output video with detected objects highlighted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (optional for running in the cloud)

### Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 dependencies (installed via `requirements.txt`)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the YOLOv5 Repository**:

   Clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
   cd yolov5
